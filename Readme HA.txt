Hash Function
Abstract: A hash function is a mathematical function that converts a numerical input value into another compressed numerical value. In the hash function, the input is always of arbitrary length but the output is always of fixed length.

Aim of the Project: Hashing is an encryption algorithm that helps you encrypt the normal text into gibberish. 

Working: Hash functions take data as an input and return an integer in the range of possible values into a hash table and then it consistently distributes the data across the entire set of possible hash values. The hash function generates completely different hash values even for similar strings.

Example: Dropbox uses a 4-layered encryption method that will ensure that the resources and time required to brute force through these layers will make the acquisition of actual data meaningless.

Application : To take up different types of hash functions and understand the working. And in future embarking on researching multi-layered encryption systems and learning how they make the data more secure.
